If you are looking to contribute to the project please do a pull request.

Our method for development is to work on the Dev branch using pull requests for good oversight.
Once a pull request is satisfactory we will accept it and merge it in.

Once a new version is ready we will build the new version. Branch it.
Then merge that branch into main.

Do not commit to main directly as users are downloading it directly.
Once a tested version is merged onto Main create a proper release.


To contibute you only need to know this process to pull request to the dev branch.
We will do the rest.
